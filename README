This is an infrared universal remote for your ATMEGA 328p device.

In addition to an Arduino, you will also need...

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1770 (SPI only)
(other displays may work but have not been tested)
https://www.adafruit.com/product/387
A 2N2222 NPN transistor
A 460 ohm resistor

Pin settings are found in ur_config.h

Solder closed the M1, M2, and M3 jumpers on the back of the display
to put it in SPI mode.  Alternatively, connect 5v digital pins to M1, M2,
and M3 on the SPI side of the device, and set them to output high in setup().

You will also need to copy the BMP files from sd-images/ to a
FAT16/32-formatted micro-SD card, and put that card in the display's
micro-SD slot BEFORE powering it on.
